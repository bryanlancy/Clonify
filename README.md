## What is Clonify?
Clonify is a clone of Spotify. The main focus for this project is to replicate the major functionalities of a music application, while using Spotify as inspiration for styling.

The data for the application is largely powered by Spotify's API. This provides up-to-date data and allows for powerful functionalities, such as search and music reccomendations.

## Setup

 <em>
    The following setup assumes that you have PostgreSQL installed and have permissions to add a new user. Documentation can be found <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">here</a>.
</em>
<br>
<em>
    You will also need access to Spotify's API. Specifically, you will need a client id and secret key as this application uses a client credentials flow for authorization with Spotify's API. Sign up or sign in to the Spotify Developer dashboard <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/">here</a>.
</em>

<br><br>

1. **Clone repository & install Node dependencies**
    1. Clone the project with:<br>
    `git clone https://github.com/bryanlancy/Clonify.git`

    1. In the root project directory run the command:<br>
    `npm run install`
1. **Setup the backend environment**
    1. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file found in the `backend` folder and rename it to `.env`.
    1. In the `.env` file, replace all values surrounded in `< >` with the corresponding information. Unless you have already done so, you can generate these values now.

        - `DB_USERNAME` - PostgreSQL user name
        - `DB_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL user password
        - `DB_DATABASE` - PostgreSQL database name
            - database will be created in a later step.
        - `JWT_SECRET` - JSON Web Token Secret
            - should be unique and secure.
        - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` - Spotify Client ID
        - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Spotify Client Secret

        <br>

        :warning: *The `.env.example` is tracked by git version control, **do not** save any sensitive information in this file.*
    1. **Create PostgreSQL user.**
        - In your terminal run, `psql`, to start PostgreSQL's interactive terminal.
        - `CREATE USER <DB_USERNAME> WITH PASSWORD '<DB_PASSWORD>' CREATEDB;`. Remember to replace the values in `< >` with the values we created in the previous step.

1. **Create & seed the database**
    1. In your terminal, navigate to the `backend` folder found in the main project directory.
    1. Then run, `npm run db-setup`. This will run a series of commands that should automatically set up your database. If any errors occur, you can run the commands individually, in this order.
        1. `npm run db-create`
        1. `npm run db-migrate`
        1. `npm run db-seed`
1. **Start the application**
    1. In your terminal, navigate to the main project folder.
    1. Then run `npm run fullstart`. This will start the backend and frontend server. <br>
        - Each server can be started manually by navigating to the respective folder, `frontend` and `backend`, and running the command `npm start`.
    1. In your browser navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>
